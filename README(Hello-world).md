# Introduction
In this Hello-world.js file what I had done- 

Installed node modules folder
Installed Express js
Installed Nodemon

Then I created an app in which I imported express.
Created a port http://localhost:3000.
Made a get request on the path '/'.
Then on server I used app.listen to call my server.
